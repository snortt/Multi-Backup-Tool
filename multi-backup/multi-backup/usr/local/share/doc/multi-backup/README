Backup tool for various system areas

This tool can (or should, at least ;P ) create backups for parts of your Linux installation.
These parts are divided by modules.
   Apache module   : creates backup for Apache related files
   Linux module    : creates backup for specific Linux configuration files
   Transfer module : transfers the backup archives to a server (see multi-backup (1))
   [...]

Well, you got the main idea.

Feel free to improve, modify and make amendments to this tool.
Don't forget to document and maintain the manpage.

Have fun!
