 will be saved as .mypwf.old and .bkpsrvauth.old (or whatever name you gave them), 
 and then new configuration files will be created based on your answers

Template: multi-backup/ask_ftpsrv
Type: string
Default:127.0.0.1

 backup it creates, so you should have an FTP backup server running on your network.
  
 If you don't have an FTP server expecting your backups, use the TRANSFER_FLAG 
 to disable backup transfers, but this is not advised as all the backups will 
 remain on the same server they are created.
